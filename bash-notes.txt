these are my bash notes



bash is a programming language
  dynamic/implicit langauge with a type system that resembles LISP; 
  s-expressions: a list where the first element is the function/command/program-to-execute and the rest of the arguments
  https://www.celantur.com/blog/bash-type-system/
  like any language, keywords evoke special behavior
  these include built-in programs like:
    -cd
    -echo
    -type
  but also special characters like 
    -$
    -(
    -{
  the special characters used for "file-globbing" are called *wildcards* and they include '*' and '?' and '[..]'


explain globbing vs regex here 
  -allow it to be the context for describing "find command"

grep for a word in all files with all folders and subfolders of a given directory
  grep -r --exclude-dir='.?*' 'o' .



history | tail -20 | grep
