these are my bash notes

explain globbing vs regex here and allow it to be the context for explaining how to use the "find command"



bash is a programming language

it's a dynamic/implicit langauge with a type system that resembles LISP; s-expressions: a list where the first element is the function/command/program-to-execute and the rest of the arguments

like any programming language, there are keywords that evoke special behavior that can be coded for interpretation of a bash interpretor

these include built-in programs like 'cd' and 'echo' and 'type', but also special characters like '$' and '(' and '{'

the special characters used for "file-globbing" are called *wildcards* and they include '*' and '?' and '[..]'

grep for a word in all files with all folders and subfolders of a given directory
  grep -r --exclude-dir='.?*' 'o' .



history | tail -20 | grep
