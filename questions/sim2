Description:
Three routers. 2 links. Static routes exist for lo0s of ibgp links. No routing protocols established.


Problem:
1) Make the one link IBGP using loopbacks. They use static routes to hit each others loopbacks.

2) R3 should be able to ping loopback of R1 and can only use BGP to accomplish this. So setup EBGP link.

3) R1 advertises a summary for three loopback networks.


Solution:
1) easy ibgp setup

2) easy ebgp setup

3) fairly simple config under ipv4 address family:
   'aggregate-address 172.16.100.0 255.255.252.0 summary-only'

   make sure you have at least one of the network configured for advertisement as well or bgp wont advertise the summary
   'network 172.16.100.0 mask 255.255.255.0'
