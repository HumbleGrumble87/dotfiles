Description:
We have 2 routers connected by a single link.
Each router has a lo0.
These links are within OSPF area 0.

Problem:
Router A also has 3x other loopbacks that can be nicely summarized.
They should show on on Router B as 172.16.100.0/22

Also, each router should be able to ping each other's loopbacks.

Solution:
Easy, 'area 1 range [prefix] [mask]'

And to ping loopbacks just add loopbacks to ospf with:
"ip ospf 10 area 0"
too eazy
