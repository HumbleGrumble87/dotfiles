Description:
OSPF b/w 2 routers with redundant links and a pair of Lo0 on each router

Problem:
1) Routers shouldn't elect DR/BDR on link A and they shouldn't advertise the connected host route?????

2) Prefer E0/0 over E0/1 interfaces using only numeric value 15

3) Set hello and dead intervals


Solution:

1) simply conf 'ip ospf network point-to-point' on the connected links
   -the "don't advertise host route to connected neighbor" is some dumb ass FRAME RELAY cisco shit

2) 'ip ospf cost 15' on the E0/1 links. Cost default is 1 so 15 will exclude those.

3) 'ip ospf hello-interval 5' and 'ip ospf dead-interval 10' on the E0/1 interfaces as well.
