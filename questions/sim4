Troubleshooting MPLS

Description:
Linear/spanning-tree/loop-free topology (straight line)

5 Routers are numbered R21-25 with Lo0s everywhere @ 100.100.100.2[1-5] /32

"...perform MPLS label forwarding-operation."


Problem:
1) Configure LDP b/w R22 and R23

2) Make sure the LDP router-id uses Lo0 "as the persistent identifier"
  -LDP defaults to lo0 anyway, but question says "ensure"
  -also i believe the "transport address" aka source address is default to the rouder-id as well

3) Modify the head and tail end (R21 and R25) to enable MPLS-TE tunnel b/w them


Solution:
1 and 2) mpls ldp router-id lo0 && router ospf 1 mpls ldp autoconfig area 0

3) mpls traffic-eng tunnels
